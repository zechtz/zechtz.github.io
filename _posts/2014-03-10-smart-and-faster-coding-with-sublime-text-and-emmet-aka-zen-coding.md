For developers, speed is always a welcome addition, that's why are always looking for ways to to add speed and effeciency to our work through automation and good decision making. A good text editor choice can sometimes be the difference between projects finishing on time and falling well short of deadlines.

Since Sublime Text is the editor 'du jour' at Watabelabs due to the amount of free plugins it has and the fact that, its easy to automate without being much of a programmer I am going to show how to harness the power of Sublime Text + the Emmet plugin to write code faster & efficient.
One of our favorite plugin is Emmet, A.K.A Zen Coding, this plugin can really boost your work experience and make you feel like you are cheating (I am serious about this), and the good thing is, Emmet is not only available for Sublime Text, it can be installed in other editors as well, just check the plugin's official site for more information.

Now I am not going to talk about how to install Emmet in Sublime Text, I will just try to show how you could use it to automate most of the stuff you do in your daily workflow.
